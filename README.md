## Scientific Computing Practical Project: Approximation of π

This project is developed as part of the Scientific Computing Practical course. It aims to implement and compare different numerical methods for approximating the mathematical constant π (pi).

### Objectives

- Implement multiple methods to approximate π
- Use Python to structure clean, efficient, and well-documented code
- Compare the performance and accuracy of each method
- Present findings in a clear and organized Jupyter notebook

### Methods Used

- Leibniz Series
- Monte Carlo Simulation
- Polygon Approximation
- Additional series and iterative techniques

### Project Structure

- `src/` – Python modules for each approximation method
- `notebooks/` – Jupyter notebooks explaining methods and results
- `tests/` – Unit tests to validate functionality
- `README.md` – Project overview and instructions
